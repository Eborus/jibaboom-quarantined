#### Good Points

1. Attributes shown at top and bottom can be useful for big table.
2. Showing total number of entries can be useful for some instance.
3. Pagination tool meets requirement

#### Bad Points

1. May need more than 1 search bar as we need to search by multiple attributes
2. Data with many column may be bad.

### Good Points

1. Table can be sorted from ascending or descending order. 
2. Unique sorting mechanic, it allows the user to sort based on two types, the column type and the option type. If the column is a int, the options will be symbols. If the     colum is a string, the options will be more varied.
3. Adaptable pagination, user can modify the amount of rows per page and even go to a specific page by typing the page number in the page box.
