# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Finished Mobile data viewer albeit the frontend is a little messy.
-   Caching is somewhat successful(?), although it is still returning an object instead of an array. Will work on fixing it during this week.

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Finish up data and result viewer for mobile as well as caching
-   Host backend to Heroku and frontend to github
-   Split index.html into data-viewer.html and result-viewer (Optional but to remain consistent with the wireframe. This will be done if there is extra time)

## Additional Thoughts

-   Learned about json responses, props, state and array init for mobile data viewer
-   Modified Rui Yang's jsonRequestorView for mapped json responses. - Jason
-   Modified Ruiy Yang's dataviewer to use mapping for the json response instead of using external libraries like useEffect()...whatever that does - Jason
