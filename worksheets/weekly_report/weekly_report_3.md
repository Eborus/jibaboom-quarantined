# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have we done last week

-   Started working on the backend api and created the database on ElephantSQL.
-   Finished the frontend look of the data viewer. The table has not been implemented yet. It will be once we're roughly done with displaying the data on the table.
-   Changed 

## What do we plan to do next week

-   Work on the different backend API (Pagination, custom filtering, display rows)
-   Fix this display issue stated below. (╬ಠ益ಠ)

## Additional Thoughts

-   Having some difficulties in displaying startTime and endTime columns on the frontend table, though it displays the data perfectly in the console and the filtering works
    despite the column being undefined (So its probably having trouble in displaying and its not the data that is affected). Not really too sure what sorcery is going on here but we'll be dedicating majority of the focus onto this component since the filter feature is working already.
