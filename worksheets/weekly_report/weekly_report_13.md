# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   More Bug fixes such as fixing pagination when the number of entries is divisible by 10.

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Finish the basic and advanced algorithms and set up the frontend for web result viewer by next week.
-   Get started on the mobile development
-   Add in the different response codes for res.json

## Additional Thoughts

-   Having some trouble with advanced algorithm, so there is a chance that this work will continue on for another week. In the meantime, its better to focus on the mobile part now
