This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Completed basic and advanced algorithms and modified them to fit the music festival schema for the assignment

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Finish the entirety of mobile
-   Finish up all the worksheets
-   Catch up on report writings, if this is here, means I've completed the report writing up to week 14.

## Additional Thoughts

-   Learned about Arrays and Arrays of Objects this week when the lecturer pointed out about array "inheritance" as I would like to term it. Where previously
for the advaned algorithm, the subsequent arrays would ref (inherit) the first array that was init. However, when I updated the first array, it carried over
to the other subsequent arrays, effectively changing all the arrays to the updated value. This issue was solved with the implementation of the [...] function
which instead of having the arrays inherit from the previous array and so on so forth, that function creates a new array independent from the previous arrays. Thus the
new value was only updated in the new array instead of the old ones as well. (Consultation not recorded, thus will be documented here).
